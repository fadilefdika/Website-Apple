# Technologies Used
- React.js: For building the user interface and managing the component-based architecture.
- Vite: For fast development with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and minimal setup.
- Three.js: For rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): For handling animations and transitions with smooth and complex effects.
- Vite + React
This project utilizes Vite for an optimized React development environment with fast refresh and ESLint integration.

Currently, two official plugins are available for React:


- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
